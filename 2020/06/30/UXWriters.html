<hr />
<p>Jeremiah Telzrow and I have collaborated on an article highlighting quality<br />
advice from industry professionals at this summer’s UX Writer Conference held<br />
virtually on June 9th and 10th. We focused on collecting and referencing the<br />
suggestions that people had and also developed visuals to make finding that<br />
content easier. Getting started in the technical writing field is no easy<br />
task, and we felt compelled to share the resources we’ve learned with others<br />
who feel the same. You can find the article at Jeremiah’s website below!</p>
