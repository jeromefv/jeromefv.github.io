<hr />
<p>This quick-reference card I developed as a tool to aid people using the AeroPress. For those looking for a great and simple<br />
brewing method, the AeroPress opens up many possibilities of amazing coffee with comparable effort to a French press. Using<br />
this document, you can cater your preferences of water, coffee, and immersion time to your own taste. You can have this<br />
attached with an AeroPress as a gift and know that theyâ€™ll be able to perform the task of making a wonderful cup of coffee<br />
on their own.</p>
