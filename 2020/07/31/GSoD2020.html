<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Matplotlib’s project suggestion for this year’s Google Season of Docs involves creating content <br />
that helps introduce Matplotlib to new users. For Developing Matplotlib Entry Paths, I propose <br />
an alternative approach to that of current documentation. I am a new technical writer to the <br />
industry; however, my background is in education and education-adjacent fields. Technical writing <br />
and education have strong parallels that focus on producing content that empathizes and enables <br />
users to accomplish their tasks with the resources provided.</p>

<p>In this context, the Matplotlib documentation would benefit with improvement to empathizing with<br />
new users. Much of the material at the moment consists of randomized data and unlabeled visuals. <br />
These are excellent for quickly displaying the visuals and the features of Matplotlib. However, <br />
for the use case of someone new to Matplotlib, it is challenging to traverse the transformation <br />
of data to visuals.</p>

<p>A context in an expository approach is a solution to this obstacle. By writing a procedure through <br />
the lens of a real world example, we are demonstrating an understanding of the environment in <br />
which a user works. This improves the relationship the documentation and user have in terms of <br />
reaching a goal or expectation of accomplishing a task.</p>

<p>A user has a consistent derived purpose, For example, a data scientist at a shoe company must <br />
present customer data to a team to illustrate shopping trends over time. In this situation, the <br />
user must learn to navigate Matplotlib and take advantage of the tools within the library to <br />
complete the task at hand.</p>

<p>With additional context to support the documentation, a new user may be more able to identify with <br />
the topic. The user’s derived purpose is parallel to the documentation. I hope to work towards the <br />
vision that Lead Developer Tom Caswell discussed in an interview in 2017 as <em>“having someone who <br />
can actually write and has empathy for users, to go through and basically write a 200-page ‘Intro to <br />
Matplotlib’ book, and have that be the main entry to the docs.”</em></p>

<h2 id="alternative-approach-of-expository-writing">Alternative Approach of Expository Writing</h2>

<p>The current documentation demonstrates the features of Matplotlib, i.e. the things a user is able to<br />
do with the library. For instance, a tutorial often follows the pattern that doesn’t involve an <br />
explanation of the underlying method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{what the method does} -&gt; {parameters} -&gt; {returns} -&gt; {related links} -&gt; {examples}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often with programming documentation and support, a user is recommended to run the code on their own<br />
to understand what happens. Although a programming mindset improves a user’s understanding of the topic,<br />
the learning curve for transformations has little supporting content. It can be an overwhelming challenge<br />
as documentation is limited.</p>

<p>Providing additional diagrams, images, or other visuals will help to create new learning opportunities. <br />
The structure below would also serve well as a template for new content. Also, the point of adding <br />
non-textual images or graphics could benefit from features like callouts and coachmarks. There are times <br />
where images are harder to navigate without indications of how or where the code is transformed into the <br />
output executed. I believe that there is a strong visual element missing that could foster a greater <br />
understanding of the topics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{method explanation} -&gt; {expository use case/scenario} -&gt; {sample code} -&gt; {parameters} -&gt; <br />
{returns} -&gt; {additional examples} -&gt; {informational topic/subject affinity links}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is massive potential in this alternative approach of using expository writing for documentation. <br />
With users seeing a variety of concepts for transformations, they would be able to better identify the <br />
underlying strategies of developing visualizations to data. This knowledge can help users innovate and <br />
take advantage of the features as presented by examples based in realistic use cases.</p>

<p>As Matplotlib grows in popularity, consistency in ease of use and approachability are testament to the <br />
library’s reputation. These characteristics lend themselves to demonstrate patterns and common strategies <br />
that can surface not only within the code, but also within the documentation. If Matplotlib is <br />
straightforward and standard for users to program, as evident in its growing use and expanding resources, <br />
it can also be that way for technical documentation.</p>

<p>When users encounter problems, it’s common to use search in order to solve them. Rather than rely on <br />
search as the primary method of navigation, it can be more impactful to have users build their own <br />
curriculum within the documentation. In this sense, a user searches for a solution to their problem, <br />
then when they encounter another problem or would like additional information, they’ll make use of <br />
embedded and thorough links throughout.</p>

<p>This would involve a bottom-up architecture in the organizational system. For every topic within Matplotlib, <br />
a rich network of links to subject affinities as well as informational topics would help to build a robust <br />
network. Throughout this network, a user would be more likely to continue using the documentation as they <br />
navigate to their topic and explore more and more information related to that topic.</p>

<h2 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h2>

<p>There are always challenges with a project as comprehensive and detailed as this. As a newer technical <br />
writer in the industry, I have limited experience using Sphinx and ReST to write documentation. I’m also <br />
a beginner when it comes to Matplotlib as well as Git. Tackling these four systems and getting comfortable <br />
with using them for collaboration and research will take time. I will need to delegate time during the <br />
community bonding phase and earlier to in order to build the necessary foundation for entry level paths. <br />
During this time, if I have issues with concepts and fundamentals, I will need to reach out to the community <br />
for additional support.</p>

<p>Coordinating collaborative efforts across time zones and over online platforms will take some adjustment <br />
as well. There are a variety of communication avenues that people all throughout the industry use, so it is <br />
a matter of making sure I am accessible and approachable in all mediums. I will be transparent in my <br />
prioritization of varying expectations throughout. Though I am only just starting out with taking on work <br />
such as this in the industry, I am invested in holding myself accountable and being open to feedback and <br />
criticism. I feel these qualities are valuable no matter the field.</p>

<p>Also, increasing usability testing is a section of documentation that I believe would benefit Matplotlib’s <br />
entry paths. Conducting surveys for usability regarding the content serves a purpose of providing a profile <br />
of a user, i.e. personas. Information such as a user’s experience, their industry, and troubleshooting history <br />
are valuable. These pieces help form the language behind the procedure. When writing meets readers at their <br />
level, content matures beyond acting as solely instructional.</p>

<p>Big struggles often lie with creating an ongoing practice of usability testing. It’s far too common to have <br />
had a single instance of testing, if done at all, during content development. Regular usability testing helps <br />
drive the narrative of the content. It would be my hope to setup a schedule or have recurring usability tests <br />
with the Matplotlib community.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have a little experience using Python as well as Matplotlib in my free time. The amount I’ve taught myself <br />
over the last few months was with the support of the current documentation and my own curiosity. There were <br />
a handful of videos and mentors I’ve had in that time as well. I’ve still got much to learn and even more room <br />
for improvement as I build my own curriculum of programming that I’m interested in.</p>

<p>After seeing the ideas that Matplotlib and the community have for GSoD, I feel like it would be an excellent <br />
growing experience to improve on my skills as a technical writer and get the chance to learn more from the <br />
folks behind the scenes. I have felt that this Matplotlib project is both meaningful and something I am <br />
passionate about in ideology.</p>

<p>For working on an overhaul of the usage guide, my goal as a technical writer is to help users accomplish the <br />
tasks that they want to without being overwhelmed by the features available. I believe that the best <br />
documentation would continue to grow and adapt to users and allow for any user to navigate to their own solutions.</p>
