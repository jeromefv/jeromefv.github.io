    <p>
    I am a motivated and detail-oriented writing professional with years of <br>
    extensive experience. My prowess is in effective correspondence for <br>
    collaboration and technical communication.</p>
    <p>As a technical writer and instructional designer, I focus on empathizing <br>
    with users and experts and bridging the communication between the <br>
    two. To me, making sure that people take in content to be able to <br>
    complete tasks is the core of what makes being a technical <br>
    communicator a passion.</p>
    <p>To learn more, you can read my <b>About</b> page, you can reach out and <br>
    <b>Contact</b> me directly, or take a look at my work and see examples of my <br>
    strategies in the the <b>Posts</b> section.</p>
    <p>Thanks and much appreciation for your time!</p>
