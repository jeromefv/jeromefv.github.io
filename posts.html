<hr />
<p>Jeremiah Telzrow and I have collaborated on an article highlighting quality<br />
advice from industry professionals at this summer’s UX Writer Conference held<br />
virtually on June 9th and 10th. We focused on collecting and referencing the<br />
suggestions that people had and also developed visuals to make finding that<br />
content easier. Getting started in the technical writing field is no easy<br />
task, and we felt compelled to share the resources we’ve learned with others<br />
who feel the same. You can find the article at Jeremiah’s website below!</p>

<p>I wrote this code in Python a few weeks ago when the NBA season<br />
came to a hiatus. It’s a histogram detailing the teams and their<br />
point for totals matched up against their points against totals.<br />
The link below contains the code in my Github.</p>

<p>This quick-reference card I developed as a tool to aid people using the AeroPress. For those looking for a great and simple<br />
brewing method, the AeroPress opens up many possibilities of amazing coffee with comparable effort to a French press. Using<br />
this document, you can cater your preferences of water, coffee, and immersion time to your own taste. You can have this<br />
attached with an AeroPress as a gift and know that they’ll be able to perform the task of making a wonderful cup of coffee<br />
on their own.</p>
