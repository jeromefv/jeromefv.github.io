      <description>Incorporating SME API notes for documentation In this sample API exercise, the notes below from an engineer were guidelines for building new content. This new Pet feature needed documentation to show how to use it and act as reference for parameters and expected responses.
Develop new documentation for API To start, I evaluated the scope of the new documentation. I looked at the organization&amp;rsquo;s current API docs to base the new content off of this framework and template.</description>

      <title>Matplotlib: Improving Specifying Colors</title>
      <link>https://jeromefv.github.io/posts/specifying-colors/</link>

      <description>In this section, Matplotlib documentation explains compatible formats for colors. These inputs are fundamental in configuing data visuals. With more streamlined information on usage and straightforward examples, users of all experience levels benefit from these improvements.
One of the challenges of parsing through the original document was differentiating the examples from the explanation. The bullet points only served to separate each type of format accepted. In the text, commas, parentheses, and phrasing connected each type of format to its respective example.</description>

      <title>Guillain-Barré Syndrome Website</title>

      <description>Here, I built and launched a website about the medical disorder known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).
I introduce and provide information about GBS in simple and straightforward terminology. Most content about this disorder uses highly specialized vocabulary catered to medical professionals. These obstacles make it challenging for patients and loved ones to understand this challenging and complex issue.
My aim as a technical writer is to increase accessibility for this subject and related topics.</description>

      <description>Advice for New Writers Session Jeremiah Telzrow and I collaborated on an article highlighting quality advice from UX/tech writers and content strategists at the UX Writer Conference held virtually on June 9th and 10th. We focused on collecting and referencing the suggestions that people had and produced visuals to make finding that content easier.
Getting started in the technical writing field is no easy task. We felt compelled to share the resources we’ve learned with others who feel the same.</description>

      <description>Instructional Aid for using the AeroPress with the inverted method.   I developed this quick-reference card as a tool to aid people using the AeroPress. For those looking for a great and simple brewing method, the AeroPress opens up many possibilities of amazing coffee with effort comparable to a French press.
Using this document, cater your preferences of water, coffee, and immersion time to your own taste. Attach this to an AeroPress as a gift knowing the end result is a wonderful cup of coffee.</description>
