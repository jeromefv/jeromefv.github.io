<h1>Twitter Docs Bulletin Board</h1>

Nov. 14, 2022


<br/><br/>
<h2 id="documentation-strategy">Documentation strategy</h2>
<p>As the Documentation Strategist at Twitter working with the Developer Relations team, I needed a single location to act as the source of truth for all things docs. This space would serve as a way for leadership and colleagues to see any upcoming work at a glance. It needed to be updated regularly and be a resource to the team if I weren&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p><img src="/images/docs_bulletin_1.png" alt="Docs Bulletin Board top page preview"></p>
<h2 id="tasks-and-actions">Tasks and actions</h2>
<p>I set up a Google Document containing recent launches, updates, project spreadsheet tracking, resources, and a &ldquo;Food for Doc&rdquo; section made up of tasteful humor. Twitter had used <code>go/</code> links to make it easier to share content internally, and I took advantage of this simple method to link to this page. These sections covered the essentials for our department and any related documentation goals. I also added the entertainment section to reward engagement and add a little personality.</p>
<p>I regularly collected all the content that makes up the Docs Bulletin Board through spreadsheets connected to Jira tickets. I added the visible spreadsheet preview of the roadmap as well. These in addition to monitoring the changelog items from the documentation platform were key.</p>

<h2 id="responses-from-the-team">Responses from the team</h2>
<p>The Docs Bulletin Board was met with praise for its convenience and simple streamlined delivery. My leadership appreciated being able to at a glance see the roadmap for documentation goals and then it became easier to discuss relevant topics and goals during one on ones. My developer relations teammates found it straightforward to view the person in charge of specific recent projects and have the links available to learn more. In addition, I was regularly able to present my work in progress as well as upcoming targets for quarterly goals with attached timelines and deliverables.</p>
<p>While the team was still active and the ownership hadn&rsquo;t changed yet, the original shared Google Doc was viewable by all on our Developer Relations department. The salvaged PDF below was all I could share at the time when our company goals shifted and resources were cut off. I&rsquo;ve redacted personal identifiers from that time as well as specific links shared.</p>
<h2 id="potential-next-steps">Potential next steps</h2>
<p>If I were to do this again, I&rsquo;d increase the automation all around to make it less of a manual effort to update. For example, I&rsquo;d build a script to automate updated links as well as check if the links were still valid. At the time, Jira integrations weren&rsquo;t as fancy for displaying the most up-to-date information, and now plugins and modules are available and seamless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also hope to have an improved design. I think the Docs Bulletin Board would be an interesting visual as well to go along with the content, and I was limited by the time I had and the Google Docs configuration.</p>
<p>I think I would also champion this process more moving forward. It&rsquo;s valuable to teams to have a single location to reference and find out all you need about that specific topic. Having a similar &ldquo;bulletin board&rdquo; for other teams and other departments could also help them and streamline their collaboration.</p>
