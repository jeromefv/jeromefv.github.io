<h1>Okta Integration Guide</h1>

<p>This how-to guide specifies all the required steps to implement Beyond Identity&rsquo;s phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (PRMFA) with Okta&rsquo;s IAM platform.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-situation-and-task-at-hand">Documentation situation and task at hand</h2>
<p>When I had started at Beyond Identity, the original guide was outdated and no longer had the correct steps to implement the product with Okta&rsquo;s platform. In addition, all of the video recordings and screenshots were different due to changes to the UI across both company products. Internal deployment engineers and product marketing managers weren&rsquo;t able to use the documentation because it wasn&rsquo;t relevant or helpful anymore.</p>
<p>One of my first major documentation tasks was to revise and update this how-to guide. It needed to focus specifically on IT administrators to implement the PRMFA product with Okta.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps-in-action">Next steps in action</h2>
<p>To start, I reviewed the existing docs for notes and met with engineers for initial feedback on the process. From there, I drafted an outline of the stages and steps for the implementation. This was helpful since the original guide and the notes from engineers had a long enumerated list of actions. I sectioned off relevant items to create a more logical and compartmentalized solution.</p>
<p>I then created test environments and accounts to run through the sections. I worked with a deployment engineer to record the actions as exposition in a linear and logical order. While collaborating with the deployment engineer, we established a timeline in the future for collecting screenshots and recordings to add to the documentation. Next, I followed up with the product engineering team lead for feedback. To finish everything, I completed the production workflow using Docusaurus and our docs-as-code CI/CD pipeline in GitHub to release documentation to public.</p>
<h2 id="responses">Responses</h2>
<p>The documentation update received positive feedback from the deployment engineer and the product engineering team. The deployment team found success when working with customers that have six figure annual recurring revenue through an improved implementation time compared to before the documentation was updated. Our product marketing team highlighted this new guide as a competitive edge in the cybersecurity and identity access management fields when viewing comparable guides from other providers.</p>
